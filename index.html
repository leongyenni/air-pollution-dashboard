                        The death rate from PM (Particulate Matter) pollution increases with greater exposure to PM 2.5 air pollution, indicating a
                        positive correlation. According to the visualisation above, we can observe that countries in Asia and Africa have higher
                        levels of exposure to PM 2.5 pollution. Therefore, we can conclude that the higher death rates from air pollution in China,
                        Malaysia, and India are likely due to the high emissions of PM 2.5 pollutants in these countries.
